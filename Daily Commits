1.To determine the number of available seats for reservation in FoodieFinds:
Reservation System:
Manage reservations with dates, times, and guest counts.
Maintain tables with varying capacities.
Availability Calculation:
Query existing reservations for a given date and time.
Calculate available seats by subtracting booked seats from total table capacity.

2. "Fortified Data Protection: Your trust is our top priority. We employ state-of-the-art encryption protocols, access controls, and continuous monitoring to ensure the safety and integrity of your user/admin information within our database.

3.Our web application allows users to easily book a table at their preferred restaurants.Users may easily browse through a wide selection of restaurants options, choose the goods they want.
Users can also just book a table at the time and date of their choice, guaranteeing a wonderful meal.
Our software seeks to give customers a simple method to take advantage of delicious cuisine and dining experiences whenever it's convenient for them.

4.This update enables the system to adjust restaurant ratings when users leave positive reviews. Now, when diners share their positive experiences, the restaurant's overall rating will reflect this feedback accurately. 
This enhancement aims to improve the reliability of restaurant ratings, making it easier for users to find top-quality dining options on FoodieFinds.

5. We've opted for role-based login for users accessing our application.

-- We have initiated the process of gathering requirements for the project.
-- we gather the information about the project and preparing the document for the project
--The app should offer restaurant recommendations based on user preferences and past dining history.
--Recommendations should be tailored to each user's taste and dining habits.



6.Secure user authentication is critical to protect personal dining preferences and ensure user privacy.
Reservation and payment information must be encrypted to facilitate secure transactions.So the customer satisfaction will be gained.



----Non Functional requirements--->
1. Performance:
Both iOS and Android devices must have fluid and responsive user interfaces offered by the program.
Product listings, image loading times, and checkout procedures should all be optimized for speedy access while taking possible network variations into account.
Even during periods of high traffic, the app should be able to manage many user interactions with efficiency and maintain acceptable response times.
2. Security:
Sensitive data, including payment information and personal information, must be transmitted and authenticated by users using encryption to protect its integrity.
Protecting user credentials and other sensitive data kept locally on the device requires the implementation of secure storage techniques.
In order to defend against typical security risks like No-SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), the app should follow recommended procedures.
3. Stability:
On both the Android and iOS operating systems, the program must be reliable, devoid of frequent crashes or strange behavior.
In particular, on devices with restricted hardware capabilities, memory management and resource consumption should be optimized to prevent performance degradation over time.
3) Sustainability:
Code quality, documentation, and version control best practices should all be adhered to by the well-organized and manageable codebase.
Enforcing modular architecture and separating concerns will help with code reuse, testing, and future improvements.
4) Backup and Restoration:
To prevent data loss in the event of hardware failures or system issues, regular backups of the application data, including user profiles, product information, and transaction records, should be carried out.
Backup schedules and retention policies should be established to guarantee that backup copies are kept for a suitable amount of time and are easily available for restoration reasons.
Point-in-time recovery techniques must be put into place to enable the program to be restored to a particular state prior to data corruption or unintentional deletions.
Backup data should be safely kept off-site or in cloud storage services to guard against calamities like fire, theft, or server failures.
Automated backup and restore procedures should be routinely observed to ensure their efficacy and quickly address any problems or malfunctions.
5. Compatibility:
Compatibility with various devices, operating systems, and web browsers to reach a broader audience. 
Integration with external APIs and services to support real-time updates for menus, availability, and reservations.
Adherence to industry standards and best practices to ensure interoperability with existing systems and technologies.
6. Availability:
Users must always be able to use the app, even during brief maintenance or update windows.
To guarantee ongoing availability even in the case of server failures or network disruptions, redundant server infrastructure and failover procedures should be in place.
7. Scalability
The application architecture should be planned to handle future increases in the number of users and the size of the product catalog.
With the option to add more server instances or cloud resources as needed, horizontal scaling should be provided to accommodate rising concurrent user activity.
To expand specific components, like databases and application servers, to effectively handle increased traffic, vertical scaling methods need to be in place.
To prevent performance bottlenecks and spread incoming traffic evenly across several server instances, load balancing solutions should be put into practice.
8.User Experience (UX):
Make sure the app works well no matter what device people are using. It should be easy for users to find what they're looking for and complete their purchases smoothly. Also, include features that make the app accessible to people with disabilities.
9.Compatibility:
Test the app on different types of Android and iOS devices to ensure it works on all of them. It should look good and function properly on screens of various sizes and shapes, and with different hardware setups.
10.Usability:
Design the app's interface to be easy to understand and visually appealing. Provide clear labels and instructions, and give users feedback about what the app is doing, like error messages and loading indicators.
